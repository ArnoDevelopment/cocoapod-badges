Cocoapod Badges are status badges to inform a pod's latest version deployed to [Cocoapods]!

The badges are created with a `SVG` file, thanks to [olivierlacan/shields](https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields) repo that provides badges to:

- [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/changelog/510d4fde56b102523a0004bf)
- [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/kaize/nastachku)
- [Gemfury/RubyGems](http://badge.fury.io/)
- [Gemnasium](http://blog.tech-angels.com/post/43141047457/gemnasium-v3-aka-gemnasium)
- [Travis CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/)

No images are generated. The badges are `SVG` files compiled by the browser. They may be saved, but if you look at their source code, you'll be able to see the `SVG` xml file.

The "badge service" is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Usage

Simple enough, all you have to do is replace the `$PODNAME` bellow with the name of the pod and the badge will automatically fetch the latest release available in [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)!

# Warning

The project fetches the latest version through [Cocoapods' search API](http://cocoapods.org/search?query=$PODNAME&ids=1&offset=0), therefore, the badge availability depends on the API's availability.
