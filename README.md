Cocoapod Badges are status badges to inform a pod's latest version deployed to [Cocoapods] through their [simple API](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods.org/commit/8ef51c7890c33ad899e8130b9e778c740c5c7f61).

The badges are created with a `SVG` file, thanks to [olivierlacan/shields](https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields) repo that provides badges to:

- [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/changelog/510d4fde56b102523a0004bf)
- [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/kaize/nastachku)
- [Gemfury/RubyGems](http://badge.fury.io/)
- [Gemnasium](http://blog.tech-angels.com/post/43141047457/gemnasium-v3-aka-gemnasium)
- [Travis CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/)

No images are generated. The badges are `SVG` files compiled by the browser. They may be saved, but if you look at their source code, you'll be able to see the `SVG` xml file.

The "badge service" is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Usage

Just replace the `$PODNAME` on both URLs and the badge will automatically fetch the info.

**_ATTENTION_**: The `$PODNAME` is case sensitive, since [Cocoapods] has differentiation! In case of unexpected issues, the badges will display "error".

## Version Badge

Displays the pod's latest version available.

## Platforms Badge

For this to be available, the pod must provide this information, which is optional. If it's not set, the badge will display "error", even though `$PODNAME` may be correct!

## Deprecation Warning

This is a new version of Cocoapod Badges! The previous version (case insensitive) is still available at `/v1/` for continuity reasons but it's **deprecated** and its support will stop! All you have to do is fix upper and lower case letters on your badge's URL.
