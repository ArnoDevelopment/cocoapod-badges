Cocoapod Badges are status badges to inform a pod's latest version deployed to [Cocoapods] through their [simple API](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods.org/commit/8ef51c7890c33ad899e8130b9e778c740c5c7f61).

The badges are created thanks to [jbowes/buckler](https://github.com/jbowes/buckler) that provides "shields-as-a-service".

The "badge service" is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Usage

Just replace the `$PODNAME` on the URLs and the badge will automatically fetch the info.

**_ATTENTION_**: The `$PODNAME` is case sensitive, since [Cocoapods] has differentiation! In case of unexpected issues, the badges will display "error".

Since the badge generation was "outsourced", for now, they can only be displayed as `PNG` images. However, the URL's `.svg` extension is still available for backwards compatibility, and there's no difference on the output for either extensions.

## Version Badge

Displays the pod's latest version available.

Some folks were having trouble with Github's cache for the README file, so I enabled a URL parameter to set the version manually.

| 1.0 | 1.1.2 | 1.0-RC1 | error |
|-----|-------|---------|-------|
| ![ios](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/NSStringMask/1.0/badge.png) | ![osx](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/NSStringMask/1.1.2/badge.png) | ![ios/osx](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/NSStringMask/1.0-RC1/badge.png) | ![error](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/error/badge.png) |

## Platforms Badge

The Platform info is optional and it may not be set in the pod's Podspec. Be sure to correctly provide this information or the badge will not work! If there's no platform info, the badge will display "error", even though `$PODNAME` may be correct!
